<h2>Reflection Q&A</h2>

<h3>How can I ensure my software is functional and secure?</h3>
<p>To make sure that my software remains functional and secure, I like to follow a specific testing process which includes unit testing and integration testing. I also utilized continuous integration tools to automate tests with every update. I also performed vulnerability scans and code reviews to maintain the integrity of the software.</p>

##

<h3>How do I understand and meet user needs?</h3>
<p>Understanding user needs starts with clear and direct forms of communication, like interviews or feedback sessions, and then translating what the user needs into user stories and requirements that end up driving the direction of the development. Involving users in the testing phase always is a good idea to help make positive that during development, the software is meeting all of the requirements and expectations while also being able to effectively addresses their issues as they may arise.</p>

##

<h3>What is my approach to software design?</h3>
<p>My personal approach to designing software usually emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability. I try to always follow SOLID principles and design patterns to make software that is easy to test, update, and modify. Also, by adopting Test-Driven Development (TDD) integrates testing into every stage of the design process, which enhances the reliability and the quality of the software.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications of Testing Techniques</h2>
<!-- <p>In this repository, I've applied various testing techniques:</p> -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Boundary Value Analysis</strong>: Used to test the limits on string lengths and numerical inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Equivalence Partitioning</strong>: Helps to streamline testing by grouping similar inputs to reduce test cases.</li>
<li><strong>Exception Handling</strong>: Used to make sure that the software can catch and handle incorrect or extreme inputs.</li>
</ul>
